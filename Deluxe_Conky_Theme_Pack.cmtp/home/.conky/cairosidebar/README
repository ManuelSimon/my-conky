Conky Cairo Sidebar
by jpope v1.0.2011.09.30

A clean looking sidebar that is completely drawn via the lua file. Cairo and Lua 
    need to be compiled into conky. On Debian, the 'conky-all' will get you what
    you need. This config completely based by manipulating scripts wrote 
    by LONDONALI1010.

Updates:
    v1.0 Initial release
        
Set up:
1. If it doesn't exist, create folder at ~/.config/conky

2. Extract archive in newly created conky folder. Path to the files should be: 
    /home/$USER/.config/conky/cairosidebar/

3. This setup uses the 'Droid Sans' and 'OpenLogos' fonts. If you don't have 
    them installed already, they are included in the fonts folder. Otherwise, 
    they can be downloaded from
    http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Droid-Sans
    http://www.dafont.com/openlogos.font

4. As downloaded, this setup assumes that 'cpu0' 'BAT0' 'wlan0' and 
    'hwmon temp 1' are your interfaces. If your system is different, edit the 
    lua as needed at 
    /home/$USER/.config/conky/cairosidebar/sidebar.lua

5. This setup is 180px wide by 568px tall. It is configured to be centered on 
    my netbook (1024x600) from top to bottom, with using a vertical panel. If 
    you use a horizontal panel, you may need to adjust the 'gap_y' setting the 
    the main config at
    /home/$USER/.config/conky/cairosidebar/conkyrc
    Make any other edits to the two files as needed.

6. Being developed on Debian systems, the available updates count is determined
    with the command
    aptitude search '~U' | wc -l | tail
    If there is a similar command for non-apt based systems, I am unaware of 
    what it is. Edit or remove from both the conkyrc and the lua as needed.

    This setup will only run the aptitude command once a day while the conky is 
    running. It writes the output of the command to a text file located
    /home/$USER/.config/conky/cairosidebar/upd
    that is then read by the lua script.

7. Start the sidebar with 
    conky -qc /home/$USER/.config/conky/cairosidebar/conkyrc &
