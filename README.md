My own conky files & conf.

To install the conky manager on a Debian-based system:

```
sudo apt-get install conky-all
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install conky-manager 
```

Then just copy-paste all the files this repo contains inside the user's home folder and launch the conky-manager. It should works.
